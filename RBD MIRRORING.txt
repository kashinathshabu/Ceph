RBD MIRRORING

THREE types ==> snapshot , journal [unidirectional / bidirectional]

On unidirectional we can only mirror rbd images from source (clusterA) => target (cluster)
On Bidirectional we can mirror images from clusterA => clusterB  &&  clusterB => clusterA

No rbd image can be used simultaneous on both cluster at the same time 
Images will be primary on the main cluster image & secondary on the backup cluster image ! 

If the same images on the both clusterA & cluster is set as primary , then it can lead to mirroring error 'split-brain' 

On both cluster
•	Create rbd-mirror service  
•	Enable mirroring module     ==>    ceph mgr module enable mirroring    

After starting rbd-mirror service rbd mirror client keyring will be created automatically

On target server 
        Create pool peer bootstrap token =>        rbd mirror pool peer bootstrap create --site-name LOCAL_SITE_NAME POOL_NAME    [LOCAL_SITE_NAME  is the name which we give locally (clusterB) ]

						   rbd mirror pool peer bootstrap create --site-name backup_ceph rbd

On main cluster 

	save the target cluster bearer token to a file 

	And import it to the cluster  =>      rbd mirror pool peer bootstrap import --site-name LOCAL_SITE_NAME --direction rx-tx POOL_NAME PATH_TO_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN  [LOCAL_SITE_NAME  is the name which we give locally (clusterB) ]

					      rbd mirror pool peer bootstrap import --site-name clusterA --direction rx-tx rbd /root/bootstrap_token_rbd-mirror.site-a



rbd create image1 --size 1024 --pool data --image-feature exclusive-lock,journaling   /    rbd feature enable POOL_NAME/IMAGE_NAME FEATURE [,FEATURE]


rbd mirror pool enable POOL_NAME MODE
